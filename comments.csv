17,"Suggestions for Renault executives and directors if they see this comment:  You'll have to give good build quality with 4-5 stars global ratings.  The interior looks cheap, please make interiors looks premium like Hyundai Creta top edition  I heard in other reviews that the infotainment system doesn't seem to have good processor and memory. It felt laggy amd the camera is very low resolution So, give us a premium infotainment system. Don't forget the speakers. I recently experienced Volkswagen Virtus speakers quality. Dayum, they're great. They have 8 speakers, very high quality sound system. Vitus interiors are also so good. If Duster interiors anything less than what I i mentioned, they're sure to lose. So, don't mess this up  We need Renault Duster Black edition  Compete with the features of Hyundai Creta top end models, including seats and others. If you do that you'll have the potential to capture good markt share of compact SUVs  Give us a range of options to buy from, like give us diesel engines too. Start from the on road price of 12L to 24L. Don't go above that price range.  Design is perfect, don't change anything  I think I covered everything! Alright let's see the new Duster in 2025 Q4 or 2026 Q1",Positive

21,"Renault & Mahindra Join Forces: 2025 Duster to Get Mahindra’s Rugged 1.5L Diesel Heart – What We Know A French-Indian Power Couple? Next-Gen Duster May Combine Renault’s Design Flair with Mahindra’s Legendary mHawk Diesel Muscle      India’s SUV battleground is set for a seismic shift! Renault India and Mahindra & Mahindra (M&M) are reportedly in advanced talks to equip the 2025 Renault Duster with Mahindra’s acclaimed 1.5-litre mHawk diesel engine, the same powerhouse driving the Thar RWD and XUV 3XO. This alliance could resurrect the Duster’s glory while redefining cost-efficient collaboration in the BS6 era. Here’s an exclusive deep dive into the engine, the SUV, and why this deal could shake up the Hyundai Creta-Tata Nexon duopoly.  The Engine: Mahindra’s 1.5L mHawk Diesel – Specs, Tech & Why Renault Wants It Key Specifications (as in XUV 3XO/Thar RWD): •	Displacement: 1,493 cc •	Power: 117 PS @ 3,750 rpm •	Torque: 300 Nm @ 1,500–2,750 rpm •	Compliance: BS6 Phase 2 (upgraded SCR + DPF) •	Transmission: Likely 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic (Renault may tweak gear ratios) •	Fuel Efficiency: 18.5–19.5 km/l (as per XUV 3XO’s figures)   Tech Highlights: •	Turbocharged Brilliance: Single turbocharger with intercooler for crisp low-end torque – ideal for off-roading and highway overtakes. •	Diesel’s Last Stand: Mahindra’s revised mHawk engine uses Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) and Diesel Particulate Filter (DPF) to meet strict BS6 Phase 2 norms, slashing NOx emissions by 70% compared to BS4. •	Proven Reliability: Over 2 lakh Thar and XUV units sold with this engine since 2020, praised for ruggedness in Indian conditions. Why Renault Needs This: •	Cost Savings: Developing a new diesel engine for India’s shrinking diesel PV market (down to 18% in 2023 from 50% in 2014) is economically unviable. Sourcing from Mahindra saves R&D costs. •	Instant Credibility: Mahindra’s diesel engines are trusted for performance and durability – a quick fix to revive Duster’s ""King of Roads"" legacy.  2025 Renault Duster: What Leaks & Rumors Reveal   Platform & Design: •	CMF-B Modular Architecture: Shared with Nissan Magnite and Renault Kiger, but heavily modified for ruggedness. Expect a longer wheelbase (+20 mm) vs. the current Duster. •	Design Inspiration: Spy shots hint at a Dacia Bigster-inspired design – bold C-shaped LED DRLs, flared wheel arches, and a floating roof. Rumor mill suggests a 4320 mm length, making it a sub-4.3m compact SUV. •	Ground Clearance: 210 mm (same as Thar), with skid plates for off-road styling. Interior & Features (Expected):   •	Tech Upgrade: 10.25-inch touchscreen with wireless Android Auto/Apple CarPlay, 7-inch digital driver display, and Renault’s latest ADAS suite (Level 1 autonomy with lane-keep assist and adaptive cruise control). •	Comfort: Ventilated front seats, panoramic sunroof, and dual-zone AC. Powertrain Options: •	Diesel: Mahindra’s 1.5L mHawk (117 PS) – the headline act. •	Petrol: 1.3L turbo-petrol (156 PS) from Nissan-Renault alliance (shared with Kiger). •	Hybrid: A 1.6L petrol-hybrid may debut later, targeting eco-conscious urban buyers.  Market Strategy: Why Diesel Still Matters in India   •	Rural Demand: Diesel accounts for 35% of SUV sales (vs. 18% overall PVs), driven by farm economies and taxi segments. •	Torque Lovers: Diesel’s 300 Nm torque (vs. 250 Nm in Creta’s 1.5L petrol) appeals to adventure seekers and highway drivers. •	Pricing Play: A diesel Duster could undercut rivals: o	Expected Price: ₹12–16 lakh (ex-showroom) o	Competitors: Hyundai Creta Diesel (₹12.5–18.7 lakh), Tata Nexon Diesel (₹10–15.5 lakh)  Expert Take: “A Masterstroke, But Risks Remain” Auto analyst Suraj Ghosh (IHS Markit): “This is a masterstroke for Renault. Mahindra’s engine is a proven workhorse, and badge engineering costs are minimal. However, Renault must ensure the Duster doesn’t look like a rebadged XUV 3XO. Differentiation in design and tech is key.” Rural Sales Guru Rajesh Kumar (Motilal Oswal): “In states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, diesel SUVs still rule. A rugged diesel Duster at ₹12 lakh could steal Scorpio-N’s budget buyers.”  The Bigger Picture: Renault-Mahindra’s Growing Synergy •	Shared Manufacturing: Renault-Nissan’s Chennai plant already builds Kiger and Magnite. Mahindra could supply engines directly, cutting logistics costs. •	EVs vs. ICE: While Renault focuses on Kwid EV and Mahindra on XUV400, this deal highlights pragmatism – ICE isn’t dead yet in India.  The Duster’s Make-or-Break Moment The 2025 Duster isn’t just another SUV – it’s Renault’s bid to reclaim relevance in India. With Mahindra’s diesel engine, a butch new design, and tech borrowed from global models, Renault is betting big on nostalgia and value. If priced aggressively, this French-Indian fusion could be the disruptor Tata Nexon once was. Launch Timeline: Expected August 2025 (unveil) with deliveries from Festive season 2025.    Final Word: While neither Renault nor Mahindra has confirmed the talks, supply-chain insiders suggest a contract is “90% finalized.” If true, the Duster 2025 could rekindle India’s diesel love affair – and give Hyundai and Tata sleepless nights. Stay tuned for updates as this story develops!  Did you know? The original Duster sold over 1.5 lakh units in India between 2012–2018. With Mahindra’s engine, Renault aims for 50,000 units/year – a 300% jump over current Duster sales!",Positive

50,"It will be very difficult for the Duster to rake volumes the way it did with the earlier model. Lot of competition and lack of diesel power train would be the major deterrents. Also, if it is a hybrid, Renault needs to look at the prices to keep it affordable. Anything upwards of 20 lakhs will find substantially less takers. I loved the way it looks BTW. Addition of soft touch plastics will add to the Wow factor. Loved the AC vents in particular. I don't want a panoramic sunroof. I don't know many many would agree with me.",Positive

238,2025!! Too late to the game I’m afraid. Atleast mid 2024 to try and make an impact in an already crowded segment.,Negative
239,The outgoing Duster is a great product in terms of practicality and experience. The downsides are the maintenance costs are high and not having broader network,Positive
240,Had a very bad experience with renault cars. Would not buy nor recommend buying there cars. Downgraded engines with no power and worst after sale service.,Negative

255,2025 is too late for the Indian market. The competition already has much better offerings in 2023!,Positive
256,"The new Duster appears more like a facelift of the older model. For Renault to thrive in the Indian market, they need to develop a completely new generation with the latest features offered by other car brands. It's crucial to keep up with competitors who provide advanced features at affordable prices. Renault's current offering lacks even basic features like a sunroof, and the absence of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) puts them behind. Simply relying on the existing model might not be sustainable in the dynamic Indian market.",Positive

It was a great hit along with it's alliance partner Nissan India Terrano.  Their primary success was their powerful 110 HP diesel engine and lower variant had 90 HP diesel engine. The present dismal sales is primarily due to discontinuation of diesel powertrain.

361,"Long way to go 2025. Until then many would be launched. Should not forget it was Renault who launched the 1st Midsized SUV. But thereafter they did nothing to stay in competition. They allowed the other Co's to launch their Cars & overtake.  They were happy &  complacent for years. They woke up to launch Captur. Same Duster in new clothing & with 25%+  increase in Pricing. Indians were not fools to accept the new featureless avatar. Hence was rejected & forced to discontinue. Same was the Suicidal case with NISSAN KICKs priced it at par with King Creata. Hence rejected & forced to quit India.  You got to study Indian requirement & competition offerings. Than package & Price it Well only than you can succeed.  Same is the case of Ghamandi VW-Skoda Cars they priced it high at the launch with big Claims they have Tested their Cars for 7 lacs kms in all Indian Roads & weather Conditions. But their Claims were fake & Cars failed with EPC, poor AC performance, Rattling & Cracking noise from doors & dash, shagging roofline, Screeching brake noise, etc.... etc. Combine Sales 4 Cars is less half than King Creata, Seltos & Verna.  That's my India & Indians. Once a Car is rejected it's rejected for ever. Do whatever you can it's labelled as FAILED model.",Neutral

367,"We may see this car only if Renault remains in India till 2025 festive season. With their uninspiring line up of cars and super late updation of its once hot selling suv it only raises concern whether they are making any significant profits.

385,Renault again getting too late to get the duster in indian market. It will get outdated as all other brands will launch more competitive suv’s of duster’s segment till 2025.

420,After the captur I have no hope that this will come in even a slightly international level form. It will be some nonsense that vaguely looks like this and nothing more. Perhaps using the kwid chassis and engine/transmission,Neutral
421,All that plastic on the front and rear bumpers is a bad idea. Those bits get scraped and dented so often in metro cities in India. With plastic those marks or dents (cracks rather) will be permanent unless you replace the whole plastic portion. With metallic parts you can get the dents repaired at any third-party repair shop and even get them repainted at certain workshops for cheaper than what the manufacturer would charge for replacing the plastic bits. I hope Renault reconsiders that option for the India launch.,Neutral
