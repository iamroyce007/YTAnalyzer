00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.350 align:start position:0%

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
Delighted to be involved. I'm guessing
 

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:13.990 align:start position:0%
Delighted to be involved. I'm guessing
it's<00:08:13.120><c> going</c><00:08:13.199><c> to</c><00:08:13.280><c> be</c><00:08:13.360><c> a</c><00:08:13.520><c> web-based</c>

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a web-based
 

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.270 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a web-based

00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
walkie-talkie. So, it's going to be
 

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.629 align:start position:0%
walkie-talkie. So, it's going to be
sending<00:08:15.599><c> voice</c><00:08:15.840><c> clips</c><00:08:16.080><c> as</c><00:08:16.240><c> though</c><00:08:16.400><c> you're</c><00:08:16.479><c> in</c>

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So, if you look in the lower left here,
 

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:20.950 align:start position:0%

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see an LED. It would probably be

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%

00:10:20.399 --> 00:10:21.750 align:start position:0%
 
right.<00:10:20.640><c> So,</c><00:10:20.800><c> this</c><00:10:20.880><c> is</c><00:10:20.959><c> day</c><00:10:21.200><c> seven</c><00:10:21.360><c> and</c><00:10:21.519><c> he</c><00:10:21.680><c> was</c>

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
right. So, this is day seven and he was
 

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.389 align:start position:0%
right. So, this is day seven and he was
getting<00:10:21.920><c> tired.</c>

00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
getting tired.
 

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:24.150 align:start position:0%
getting tired.
&gt;&gt; I<00:10:22.560><c> got</c><00:10:22.640><c> a</c><00:10:22.800><c> little</c><00:10:22.880><c> bit</c><00:10:23.040><c> distracted</c><00:10:23.920><c> still</c>

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:24.160 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I got a little bit distracted still
 

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.990 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; I got a little bit distracted still
seeing<00:10:24.560><c> the</c><00:10:24.800><c> age</c><00:10:25.360><c> ticking</c><00:10:25.680><c> away.</c>

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.190 align:start position:0%
seeing the age ticking away.
&gt;&gt; So,<00:10:26.160><c> it</c><00:10:26.320><c> basically</c><00:10:26.640><c> has</c><00:10:26.800><c> the</c><00:10:27.040><c> same</c>

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So, it basically has the same
 

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.990 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; So, it basically has the same
functionality<00:10:28.160><c> as</c><00:10:28.880><c> a</c><00:10:29.120><c> stopwatch,</c>

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
functionality as a stopwatch,
 

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.230 align:start position:0%
functionality as a stopwatch,
&gt;&gt; but<00:10:30.160><c> it</c><00:10:30.399><c> does</c><00:10:30.560><c> kind</c><00:10:30.720><c> of</c><00:10:30.880><c> look</c><00:10:31.120><c> like</c><00:10:31.279><c> it's</c><00:10:31.600><c> not</c>

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; but it does kind of look like it's not
 

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.430 align:start position:0%

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:40.720 align:start position:0%

00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:14.079 align:start position:0%
a huge space for a user to tap. So, you
 

00:11:14.079 --> 00:11:16.069 align:start position:0%
a huge space for a user to tap. So, you
might<00:11:14.320><c> want</c><00:11:14.480><c> to</c><00:11:15.040><c> consider</c><00:11:15.600><c> the</c><00:11:15.920><c> different</c>

types of interactions here, whether that

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:20.640 align:start position:0%
circle is big enough for someone to tap.
 

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:22.069 align:start position:0%
circle is big enough for someone to tap.
And<00:11:20.800><c> with</c><00:11:20.959><c> some</c><00:11:21.120><c> of</c><00:11:21.200><c> these</c><00:11:21.440><c> widgets,</c><00:11:21.760><c> again,</c>

And with some of these widgets, again,
 

00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:23.590 align:start position:0%
And with some of these widgets, again,
like<00:11:22.320><c> that's</c><00:11:22.480><c> just</c><00:11:22.640><c> the</c><00:11:22.800><c> size</c><00:11:22.959><c> of</c><00:11:23.120><c> the</c><00:11:23.200><c> widget.</c>

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
like that's just the size of the widget.
 

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:25.350 align:start position:0%
like that's just the size of the widget.
So,<00:11:23.839><c> having</c><00:11:24.000><c> two</c><00:11:24.320><c> interactions</c><00:11:24.880><c> here</c><00:11:25.120><c> could</c>

So, having two interactions here could
